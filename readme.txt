1. Extract the .zip file to a desired location.


2. Start the MySQL server.


3. Open the command terminal.


4. In the mysql command terminal, type the following : source <file_path>/load_library.sql

5. In the command prompt, go to the location of lib.jar and type the following command: java -jar library_manage.jar


6. We can also import the project into Eclipse IDE to run. 


7. The application will be launched.

The only technical dependency is that the system must support JAVA and MYSQL. No other extra libraries are required.
